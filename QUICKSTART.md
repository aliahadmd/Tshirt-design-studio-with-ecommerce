## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Port 3001 already in use?**
```bash
# Change PORT in backend/.env to a different number
PORT=3002
```

**Database errors?**
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Frontend Issues

**Port 5173 already in use?**
The dev server will automatically use the next available port.

**Module not found errors?**
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Can't connect to backend?**
Make sure the backend is running on port 3001 and check CORS settings.
