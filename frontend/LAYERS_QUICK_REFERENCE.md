## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Quick Selection**: Just click any layer to select it
2. **Quick Toggle**: Click eye icon to quickly hide/show
3. **Lock Before Save**: Lock finished layers to prevent accidents
4. **Use Undo Freely**: Undo/Redo work for all major operations
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use `Ctrl+Z` for fast undo
6. **Layer Order**: Top layers in panel render in front on T-shirt
7. **Drag to Position**: Drag the blue indicator to precisely position designs

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **Text Layers**: Not yet rendered (coming soon)
2. **Rotation/Scale**: Only move (translate) is available (coming soon)
3. **Multi-Select**: Can only select one layer at a time (coming soon)
4. **Layer Groups**: No folder organization yet (coming soon)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see my layer on the T-shirt"
- ✅ Check if layer is visible (eye icon should be green)
- ✅ Check if layer is behind another layer (use arrows to reorder)
- ✅ Check the scale - might be too small (shows in layer info)

### "I can't move my layer"
- ✅ Check if layer is locked (lock icon should be gray/unlocked)
- ✅ Make sure layer is selected (should have blue background)
- ✅ Look for the blue indicator on the T-shirt

### "Up/Down arrows are disabled"
- ✅ Top layer can't move up (already in front)
- ✅ Bottom layer can't move down (already in back)
- ✅ This is normal behavior

### "Undo button is disabled"
- ✅ No history available (first action)
- ✅ Visibility/Lock toggles don't create history (by design)
- ✅ Try doing an Add/Delete/Move operation first

### "My layer disappeared"
- ✅ Check Layers panel - might be hidden
- ✅ Check if you accidentally deleted it (use Undo)
- ✅ Make sure you're on the Layers tab (not Settings)

## 🎯 Example Workflows

### **Creating a Logo Design**
1. Upload logo image → "Logo Design" layer created
2. Drag blue indicator to position on chest

4. Lock layer when satisfied
5. Add more layers if needed

### **Reordering Multiple Layers**
1. Select bottom layer
2. Click up arrow multiple times to move forward
3. Check T-shirt to see render order
4. Adjust as needed
5. Use Undo if you make a mistake

### **Testing Different Designs**
1. Add multiple design layers
2. Hide all except one (click eye icons)
3. Check how each looks individually
4. Show multiple together to compare
5. Delete unwanted designs
