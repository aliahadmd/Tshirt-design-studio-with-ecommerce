- ✅ **Quick tips section** at bottom with helpful hints
- ✅ **View indicator badge** on 3D preview

### 4. **Better User Experience**

#### Workflow Improvements:
1. **Design directly on T-shirt** - Canvas design is applied as texture to 3D model
2. **Smooth transitions** - Animated rotation between front/back
3. **Visual feedback** - All actions have clear feedback
4. **Guided design area** - Blue lines show safe printing zone
5. **Professional toolkit** - Similar to Canva/TeeSpring interfaces

#### Quality Enhancements:
- ✅ **High-resolution textures** (2x multiplier for crisp designs)
- ✅ **Retina display support** for sharp rendering
- ✅ **Better lighting** for realistic fabric appearance
- ✅ **Studio environment** preset for professional look
- ✅ **Contact shadows** for depth perception

## 📊 Technical Improvements

### 3D Rendering:
```typescript
// Better materials with fabric-like properties
roughness: 0.6  // Fabric texture feel
metalness: 0.1  // Slight sheen
```

### Canvas Quality:
```typescript
// Higher quality exports
multiplier: 2  // 2x resolution
enableRetinaScaling: true  // Sharp on high-DPI displays
```

### Advanced Geometry:
- ExtrudeGeometry with proper curves for realistic shape
- Bevel settings for rounded edges
- Proper UV mapping for texture application

## 🚀 How to Use New Features

### Design Workflow:
1. **Choose a view mode** - Split view recommended for beginners
2. **Select T-shirt color** - Click preset or use color picker
3. **Add elements** - Use the enhanced toolbar buttons
4. **Apply effects** - Use stroke, shadows, and layers
5. **Stay in safe zone** - Keep design inside blue lines
6. **Preview in 3D** - See real-time updates on the T-shirt
7. **Switch sides** - Toggle between front and back
8. **Save & order** - Save design and add to cart

### Pro Tips:
- 🎨 Use **stroke** on text for better visibility on colored shirts
- 📐 Keep important elements **inside blue dashed lines**
- 🔄 Use **layer controls** to arrange overlapping elements
- 👕 Preview on **different T-shirt colors** before saving
- 💾 **Save often** to avoid losing work
- 📱 Use **split view** to see changes in real-time

## 🎬 Visual Enhancements

### Before & After:
```
BEFORE: [□ Simple Box] → Canvas Design (separate)
AFTER:  [👕 Realistic T-shirt] ← Canvas Design (mapped as texture)
```

### Lighting Setup:
- Ambient light (soft overall illumination)
- Directional lights (main highlights from 3 angles)
- Spotlight (top-down accent)
- Environment (realistic reflections)
- Contact shadows (ground connection)

### Material Properties:
```typescript
T-shirt fabric feel:
- Roughness: 0.6 (soft fabric texture)
- Metalness: 0.1 (slight sheen)
- Color: User selected
- Texture: Design canvas as PNG
```
